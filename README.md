Developed a Stroke Prediction System using Flask, React.js, and machine learning to assess stroke risk from patient health data. Built a scikit-learn pipeline with SMOTE oversampling, feature engineering, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), achieving 0.84 ROC-AUC via cross-validation. Designed an interactive React frontend for user input and deployed a Flask REST API for real-time predictions. Demonstrated expertise in full-stack development, ML model deployment, and medical data analysis.

Key Points:
1. Built an end-to-end stroke prediction system with Flask backend and React frontend.

2. Trained an LDA model (ROC-AUC: 0.84) using SMOTE for class imbalance.

3. Engineered features with OneHotEncoder, PowerTransformer, and SimpleImputer.

4. Deployed a REST API for real-time predictions via HTTP requests.

5. Developed a user-friendly React form for medical data input.

6. Applied cross-validation (Repeated Stratified K-Fold) for reliable model evaluation.
